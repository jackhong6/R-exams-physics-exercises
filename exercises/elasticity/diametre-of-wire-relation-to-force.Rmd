Question
========
The weight that will cause a wire of diameter $d$ to stretch a given distance, for a fixed length of wire, is

Answerlist
----------
* proportional to $d$
* proportional to $d^2$
* inversely proportional to $d$
* inversely proportional to $d^2$
* independent of $d$

Solution
========
The force required to stretch a wire a given distance, for a fixed length of wire is described by the equation

$$F = E \frac{\Delta L}{L_0} A$$
Where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wire. The area of a circle is
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\pi}{4} \right) d^2$$
So $F \propto A \propto d^2$ and we see that the weight that will cause a wire of diameter $d$ to stretch a given distance, for a fixed length of wire, is proportional to $d^2$.
