Question
========
What is the slope of a stress versus strain graph?

Answerlist
----------
* Young's modulus
* Elastic modulus
* Bulk modulus
* Spring constant
* Compressibility
* Pressure

Solution
========
The slope of a stress versus strain graph is called the **elastic modulus** or **Young's modulus**.

$$E=\frac{F/A}{\Delta L / L_0} = \frac{\text{stress}}{\text{strain}}$$
