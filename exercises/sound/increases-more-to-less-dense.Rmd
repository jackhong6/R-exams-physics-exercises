Question
========
A wave travels from a more‑dense medium into a less‑dense medium. 
Which quantities must be greater for the transmitted wave than for the incident wave? **Select all that apply.**

Answerlist
----------
* speed
* wavelength
* period
* frequency


Solution
========
When moving from a more dense medium to a less dense one, the speed and the wavelength
are greater for the transmitted wave than the incident wave. The frequency and the
period remain the same.
