Question
========
A student has two tuning forks, one with a frequency of `r f` Hz and the other
with frequency unknown. When struck together, the tuning forks produce `r b` beats
per second. What are the possible frequencies of the unknown tuning fork?
**Select all that apply**.


AnswerList
----------
* `r f + b` Hz
* `r f - b` Hz
* `r fmt(f / b, 0)` Hz
* `r f` Hz
* `r f + 2*b` Hz
* `r f - 2*b` Hz

Solution
========
The beat frequency is $f_{beat} = |f_2 - f_1|$
Therefore, the two possible frequencies are 

$$ f_1 - f_{beat} = `r f - b` \,\mathsf{Hz} $$

and 

$$f_1 + f_{beat} = `r f + b` \,\mathsf{Hz}$$
