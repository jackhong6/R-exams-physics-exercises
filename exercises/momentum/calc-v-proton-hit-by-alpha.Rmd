Question
========
A proton at rest is struck head-on by an alpha particle 
(which consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons) moving at speed $v$. If the collision
is completely elastic, what speed will the alpha particle have after the collision?
Assume that the neutron's mass is equal to the proton's mass.

Answerlist
----------
* $(5/3) v$
* $(3/5) v$
* $(1/4) v$
* $(1/5) v$

Solution
========
The general solution for an elastic collision in 1D is

$$v_1' = \frac{(m_1 - m_2) v_1 + 2 m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2}$$
When $m_1 = 4 m_2$, $v_1 = v$, and $v_2 = 0$, this simplifies to
$$v_1' = (3/5) v$$
