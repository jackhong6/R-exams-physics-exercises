Question
========
A ball moving due east at $`r v` \,\mathsf{m/s}$ collides with a wall.
As a result, the ball moves due west at $`r v` \,\mathsf{m/s}$. Which of the
following best describes the collision?

Answerlist
----------
* Elastic.
* Inelastic.
* Completely inelastic.
* Any of the above, depending on the mass of the ball.

Solution
========
The collision described conserves kinetic energy. Therefore, it is an elastic
collision.
