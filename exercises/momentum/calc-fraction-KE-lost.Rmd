```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
m <- sample(1000:1500, 1) # car mass (kg)
n <- sample(2:10, 1) # truck mass / car mass
v <- sample(10:99, 1) # speed of car
```

Question
========
A car of mass $`r m`$ kg, traveling with a velocity $`r v`$ km/h, strikes a parked truck of mass $`r m*n`$ kg head-on. The bumpers lock together in this completely inelastic collision. What fraction of the initial
kinetic energy is lost in the collision?

Answerlist
----------
* $1 / `r n`$
* $1 / `r n + 1`$
* $1 / `r n^2`$
* $`r n` / `r n+1`$

Solution
========
Consevation of momentum for an inelastic collision in 1D with $v_2 = 0$
$$m_1 v_1 = (m_1 + m_2) v'$$

The fraction of kinetic energy lost is $\Delta KE / KE$
$$\Delta KE / KE = \frac{m_1 v_1^2 / 2 - (m_1 + m_2) v'^2 / 2}{m_1 v_1^2/2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{m_2/m_1}{1 + m_2/m_1}$$
When $m_2 / m_1 = `r n`$, this simplifies to
$$\frac{`r n`}{`r n+1`}$$
