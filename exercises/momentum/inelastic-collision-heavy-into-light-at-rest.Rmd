Question
========
A very heavy ball rolling with speed $v$ collides with a very light ball at 
rest. If the collision is completely inelastic, then the speed of the combined 
mass after the collision is approximately

Answerlist
----------
* $0$
* $v/2$
* $v$
* $2v$

Solution
========
The very light ball will have very little effect on the very heavy ball and so
the combined mass will hardly change. Using conservation of momentum, we can see
that

$$v' = \left(\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_1$$
If $m_2 \ll m_1$, then $m_1 / (m_1 + m_2) \approx 1$.
