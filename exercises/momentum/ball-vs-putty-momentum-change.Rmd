Question
========
A rubber ball and a lump of putty have equal mass. They are both thrown with 
equal speed at a wall. The rubber ball bounces back with nearly the same speed 
with which it hit the wall. The putty sticks to the wall. Which object 
experiences the greater momentum change?

Answerlist
----------
* The ball.
* The putty.
* Both experience the same momentum change.
* Cannot be determined from the information given.

Solution
========
The ball experiences the greater momentum change. The ball's change in velocity 
is double the putty's and so the ball experiences double the momentum change.

For the ball, the final velocity is nearly its initial velocity, but in the
opposite direction:
$$\Delta v = v_f - v_i = - v_i - v_i = -2vi$$
For the putty, the final velocity is zero:
$$\Delta v = v_f - v_i = 0 - v_i = -v_i$$
