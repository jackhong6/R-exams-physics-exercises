Question
========
Two equal mass balls, one red and one blue, are dropped from the same height,
and bounce off the floor. The red ball bounces higher than the blue ball. Which
ball is subjected to the greater magnitude of impulse during its collision with
the floor?

Answerlist
----------
* The red ball.
* The blue ball.
* Both balls were subjected to the same impulse.
* It depends on the elasticity of the collisions.

Solution
========
Both balls hit the floor with the same speed, but the red one rebounds with a
greater speed (since it goes higher). Therefore, the red ball had the greater
change in momentum and must have experienced the greater impulse.
