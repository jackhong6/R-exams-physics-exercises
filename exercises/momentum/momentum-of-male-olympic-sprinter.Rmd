Question
========
The momentum of a male Olympic sprinter in the middle of a 100 m dash is about

Answerlist
----------
* $10^1 \,\mathsf{kg\,m/s}$
* $10^2 \,\mathsf{kg\,m/s}$
* $10^3 \,\mathsf{kg\,m/s}$
* $10^4 \,\mathsf{kg\,m/s}$

Solution
========
The mass of a male Olympic sprinter is about $10^2 \,\mathsf{kg}$. An Olympic 
sprinter can run $100 \,\mathsf{m}$ in about $10 \,\mathsf{s}$, which means that
his average speed is about $10 \,\mathsf{m/s}$. Therefore, his momentum is

$$p = mv = (10^2 \,\mathsf{kg})(10 \,\mathsf{m/s}) = 10^3 \,\mathsf{kg\,m/s}$$
