Question
========
A very light object moving to the right collides with a very heavy object at rest.
After the collision, the heavy object moves to the right with a small speed, and the
light object moves to the left. Which object experienced the greater magnitude of impulse
during the collision?

Answerlist
----------
* The heavy object.
* The light object.
* Both objects experienced the same magnitude of impulse.
* Cannot be determined from the information given.

Solution
========
Both objects experienced the same force (Newton's Third Law of Motion) for the 
same amount of time. Therefore, they both experienced the same magnitude of impulse.
