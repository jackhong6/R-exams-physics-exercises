Question
========
A very light ball and a very heavy ball move in opposite directions toward each 
other with the same speed $v$. If the balls hit each other head on and the
collision is elastic, then the speed of the lighter ball after the collision is approximately

Answerlist
----------
* $0$
* $v$
* $2v$
* $3v$

Solution
========
Conservation of momentum and kinetic energy gives the general result for an
elastic collision in 1 dimension

$$v_1` = \frac{(r - 1)v_1 + 2v_2}{r + 1}$$
where $r = m_1 / m_2$. Let $m_1$ be the mass of the very light ball and let 
$v_1 = v$ be its velocity before the collision. Then $v_2 = -v$ and $m_2 \gg m_1$.
This means that $r \approx 0$ and the above expression becomes $-3v$. Therefore,
the speed of the lighter ball after the collision is approximately $3v$.
