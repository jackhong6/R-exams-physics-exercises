Question
========
A very heavy ball rolling with speed $v$ collides with a very light ball at 
rest. If the collision is elastic, then the light ball's speed after the 
collision is approximately

Answerlist
----------
* $v/2$
* $v$
* $2v$
* $3v$

Solution
========
Conservation of momentum and kinetic energy with $v_2 = 0$ gives the velocity of
the light ball after the collision

$$v_2` = \left(\frac{2 m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_1$$
When $m_1 \gg m_2$, the factor $2 m_1 / (m_1 + m_2)$ is approximately 
$2$, which means that the light ball has about twice the velocity of the heavy ball.
