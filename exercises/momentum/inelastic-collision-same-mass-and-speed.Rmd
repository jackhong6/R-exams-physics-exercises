Question
========
Two balls of equal mass roll straight toward each other with the same speed $v$ and 
collide head on. If the collision is completely inelastic, then the speed of the
combined mass after the collision is

Answerlist
----------
* $0$
* $v/2$
* $v$
* $2v$

Solution
========
The total momentum before is zero and must remain zero after the collision.
