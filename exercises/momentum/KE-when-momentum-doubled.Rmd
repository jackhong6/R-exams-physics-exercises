Question
========
Consider two balls of equal mass moving at different speeds. Ball 1 has double 
the momentum of ball 2. How does the kinetic energy of ball 1, $KE_1$, compare to
the kinetic energy of ball 2, $KE_2$?

Answerlist
----------
* $KE_1 = KE_2$
* $KE_1 = \sqrt{2} KE_2$
* $KE_1 = 2 KE_2$
* $KE_1 = 4 KE_2$

Solution
========
Kinetic energy is proportional to momentum squared.
$$KE = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$ 

So when momentum is doubled, the kinetic energy must quadruple.
$$KE_1 = 4 KE_2$$
