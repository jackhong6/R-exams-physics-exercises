Question
========
Consider two balls of equal mass moving at different speeds. Ball 1 has double 
the kinetic energy of ball 2. How does the momentum of ball 1, $p_1$, compare to
the momentum of ball 2, $p_2$?

Answerlist
----------
* $p_1 = p_2$
* $p_1 = \sqrt{2} p_2$
* $p_1 = 2 p_2$
* $p_1 = 4 p_2$

Solution
========
Momentum is proportional to the square root of kinetic energy.
$$p = \sqrt{2m E_k}$$
