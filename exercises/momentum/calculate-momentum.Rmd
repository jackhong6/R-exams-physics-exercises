```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
m <- sample(10:99, 1) # kg
v <- sample(10:99, 1) # m/s

choices <- c(m*v, 0.5*m*v, m*v^2, 0.5*m*v^2, m/v, v/m)
choices <- signif(choices, 2)
choices <- sprintf("\\SI{%g}{\\kg.\\m / \\s}", choices)
```

Question
========
An object of mass \SI{`r m`}{kg} is moving with speed \SI{`r v`}{m/s}. How much momentum does the object have?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(choices, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
========
The momentum of the object is the product of its mass and velocity.
$$
p = mv = (\SI{`r m`}{\kg})(\SI{`r v`}{\m/\s}) = `r choices[1]`
$$
