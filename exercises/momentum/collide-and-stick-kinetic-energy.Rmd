Question
========
Two objects collide and stick together. Kinetic energy is

Answerlist
----------
* definitely conserved.
* definitely not conserved.
* conserved only if the collision is elastic.
* conserved only if there is no friction.

Solution
========
Kinetic energy is conserved only if the collision is elastic. However, if the two
objects stick together, then the collision is definitely inelastic. Therefore,
kinetic energy is definitely not conserved.
