Question
========
A ball of mass $m$ rolls with speed $v$ towards another ball of mass 
$`r n` m$ at rest. If the collision is completely inelastic, what is the speed of the
combined mass after the collision?


Answerlist
----------
* $`r n`v$
* $v / `r n`$
* $v / `r n + 1`$
* $v / `r n^2`$



Solution
========
Conservation of momentum

$$m v = \left(m + `r n`m \right) v'$$
Solve for $v'$
$$v' = \left(\frac{m}{m + `r n`m} \right) v = \left(\frac{1}{1 + `r n`} \right) v = v / `r n+1`$$
