Question
========
An object of mass $m$ is moving with momentum $p$. Which of the following
represents its kinetic energy?

Answerlist
----------
* $p^2 / (2m)$
* $m p^2 / 2$
* $mp$
* $mp / 2$

Solution
========
Momentum is 
$$p = mv$$
While kinetic energy is
$$KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$$
So in terms of momentum, kinetic energy is
$$KE = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$
