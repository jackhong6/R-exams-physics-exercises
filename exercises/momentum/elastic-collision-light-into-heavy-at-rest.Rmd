Question
========
A very light ball rolling with speed $v$ collides with a very heavy ball at 
rest. If the collision is elastic, then the light ball's speed after the 
collision is approximately

Answerlist
----------
* $0$
* $v/2$
* $v$
* $2v$

Solution
========
Conservation of momentum and kinetic energy with $v_2 = 0$ gives the velocity of
the light ball after the collision

$$v_1` = \left(\frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_1$$
When $m_1 \ll m_2$, the factor $(m_1 - m_2) / (m_1 + m_2)$ is approximately 
$-1$, which means that the ball bounces back with the same velocity $v$.
