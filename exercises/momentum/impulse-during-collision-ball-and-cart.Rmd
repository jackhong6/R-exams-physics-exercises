Question
========
A light rubber ball moving at high speed strikes a heavy stationary cart. 
As a result of the collision, the rubber ball rebounds and the cart rolls forward.
Which object experienced the greater magnitude of impulse?

Answerlist
----------
* The rubber ball.
* The cart.
* Both experienced the same magnitude of impulse.
* It depends on whether the collision was elastic or inelastic.

Solution
========
Both objects experienced the same force (Newton's Third Law of Motion) for the 
same amount of time. Therefore, they both experienced the same magnitude of impulse.
