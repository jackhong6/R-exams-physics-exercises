Question
========
For which of the following is the magnitude of the displacement equal to the distance traveled? *Select all that apply.*

Answerlist
----------
* A car speeding up in a straight line.
* A car coming to a stop in a straight line.
* A train moving with constant velocity.
* An apple falling straight down to the ground.
* An athlete running a lap around the track.
* A pendulum swinging back and forth.
* A car driving around the block.
* A student pacing back and forth thinking about physics.


Solution
========
The magnitude of the displacement is equal to the distance traveled when the 
motion is in a straight line because then the vectors all point in the same
direction. Note that "constant velocity" implies that the motion is in a 
straight line.
