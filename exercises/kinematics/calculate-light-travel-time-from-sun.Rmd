Question
========
How many seconds would it take the Sun's light to reach Earth? The speed of light in vacuum is \SI{3.00E8}{m/s}. The Sun is \SI{1.5E11}{m} from the Earth.


Answerlist
----------
* \SI{0}{s}
* \SI{2.0E-3}{s}
* \SI{5.0E2}{s}
* \SI{4.5E19}{s}


Solution
========
Use the formula for constant velocity motion.

$$ t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{\SI{1.5E11}{m}}{\SI{3E8}{m/s}} = \SI{5.0E2}{s}$$
