Question
========
How many seconds would it take the Sun's light to reach Earth? The speed of light in vacuum is $3.0 \times 10^8$ m/s. The Sun is $1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m from the Earth.

Answerlist
----------
* $5.0 \times 10^2$ s
* $0$ s
* $4.5 \times 10^{19}$ s
* $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ s

Solution
========
Use the formula for constant velocity motion.

$$ t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^{11} \text{ m}}{3.0 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} = 5.0 \times 10^2 \text{ s}$$
