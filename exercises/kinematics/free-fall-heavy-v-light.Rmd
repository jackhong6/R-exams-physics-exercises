Question
========
A \SI{5}{kg} ball and a \SI{10}{kg} ball are both dropped off a cliff at the same time. If air drag can be ignored, then the \SI{10}{kg} ball falls


Answerlist
----------
* \SI{50}{\percent} faster than the \SI{5}{kg} ball.
* with double the velocity of the \SI{5}{kg} ball.
* with double the acceleration of the \SI{5}{kg} ball.
* with the same acceleration as the \SI{5}{kg} ball.


Solution
========
The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth does not depend on the object's mass. All objects in free fall move with the same acceleration if air drag can be ignored.
