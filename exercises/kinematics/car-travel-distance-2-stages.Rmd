Question
========
A car travels at $50$ km/h for 30 minutes and $80$ km/h for 1 hour and 15 minutes. How far does it travel in this time?

Answerlist
----------
* $125$ km
* $130$ km
* $113.75$ km
* $117$ km

Solution
========
Use the formula for constant velocity motion for each part and add the two distances together.

$$ d = v_1 t_1 + v_2 t_2 = (50 \text{ km/h})(0.5 \text{ h}) + (80 \text{ km/h})(1.25 \text{ h}) = 125 \text{ km}$$
