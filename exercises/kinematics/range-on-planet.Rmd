Question
========
The acceleration of gravity on Planet X is $`r x`g$, where $g$ is the acceleration of gravity on Earth. If you hit a baseball on this planet with the same speed and angle that you would on Earth, the ball would land

Answerlist
----------
* the same distance away
* $`r x`$ times as far
* $1/`r x`$ times as far
* $`r x`^2$ times as far

Solution
========
The air time of the ball can be calculated from the formula $v_f = v_i + at$ with $v_f = -v_i$. 

$$t = -\frac{2v_i}{a}$$
On Earth, the time is $t_{Earth} = -2 v_i / g$. On Planet X, $g_{X} = `r x`g$ so

$$t_{X} = -\frac{2 v_i}{`r x`g} = \frac{t_{Earth}}{`r x`}$$

The air time of the ball is $1/`r x`$ times the air time on Earth. Since the horizontal velocity is the same, the ball will travel $1/`r x`$ times as far.
