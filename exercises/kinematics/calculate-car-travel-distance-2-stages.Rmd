Question
========
A car travels at \SI{50}{km/h} for \SI{30}{minutes} and \SI{80}{km/h} for \SI{1}{hour} and \SI{15}{minutes}. How far does it travel in this time?

Answerlist
----------
* \SI{125}{km}
* \SI{130}{km}
* \SI{113.75}{km}
* \SI{117}{km}

Solution
========
Use the formula for constant velocity motion for each part and add the two distances together.

$$ d = v_1 t_1 + v_2 t_2 = (\SI{50}{km/h})(\SI{0.5}{h}) + (\SI{80}{km/h})(\SI{1.25}{h}) = \SI{125}{km}$$
