or a bike that goes from 0 to 10 km/h in the same time?


Answerlist
----------
* The car has the greater acceleration.
* The bike has the greater acceleration.
* The car and the bike have the same acceleration.
* Not enough information given to determine the answer.

Acceleration is the change in velocity over time. The change in velocity is the same
(+10 km/h) in both cases. Therefore, both the car and the bike have the same acceleration.
