Question
========
The acceleration of gravity on the Moon is one-sixth of that on Earth. If you hit a baseball on the Moon with the same speed and angle that you would on Earth, the ball would land

Answerlist
----------
* the same distance away
* one-sixth as far
* 6 times as far
* 36 times as far

Solution
========
The air time of the ball can be calculated from the formula $v_f = v_i + at$ with $v_f = -v_i$. 

$$t = -\frac{2v_i}{a}$$
On Earth, the time is $t_{Earth} = -2 v_i / g_{Earth}$. On the Moon, $g_{Moon} = g_{Earth} / 6$ so

$$t_{Moon} = -\frac{2 v_i}{g_{Earth} / 6} = 6 \times \frac{-2 v_i}{g_{Earth}} = 6 t_{Earth}$$

The air time of the ball is 6 times greater on the Moon than on Earth. Since the horizontal velocity is the same, the ball will travel six times as far.
