Question
========
Which choice best matches the given position-time graph? 

```{r p-t-graph-speeding-up-to-the-left, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.height=1.5, fig.path="", results="hide"}
t <- seq(0, 1, by=0.01)
p <- 1-t^2
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1), pty="s", xaxt="n", yaxt="n")
plot(t, p, type="l", lwd=2, col="red", xlab="", ylab="")
title(xlab="time", ylab="position", line=0.2)
dev.off()
```

Answerlist
----------
* moving to the right and speeding up.
* moving to the right and slowing down.
* moving to the left and speeding up.
* moving to the left and slowing down.


Solution
========
The object is moving to the right if its position is increasing and moving to the left if its position is decreasing. 
The object is speeding up if the tangent line is becoming more vertical and slowing down if the tangent line is becoming more horizontal.

This graph describes an object that is moving to the left and speeding up.
