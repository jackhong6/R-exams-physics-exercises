Question
========
A car traveling at speed $v$ is able to stop in a distance $d$. Assuming the same constant acceleration, what distance does this car require to stop when it is traveling at speed $`r n`v$?

Answerlist
----------
* $d$
* $\sqrt{`r n`} d$
* $`r n` d$
* $`r n^2` d$

Solution
========
Solve $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$ for $d$ and set $v_f = 0$ to get

$$d = -\frac{v_i^2}{2a}$$ 
Therefore, the braking distance is proportional to the square of the initial velocity. If the initial velocity is multiplied by $`r n`$, then the car would need $`r n`^2$ times the distance to stop.
