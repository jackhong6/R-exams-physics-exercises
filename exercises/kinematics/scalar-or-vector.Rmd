```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
n <- sample(0:1, 1)
scalars <- c("50 km", "9.8 m/s/s", "50 km/h", "28 degrees Celsius")
vectors <- c("50 km, North", "9.8 m/s/s, down", "50 km/h, East", "37 N, right")
```

Question
========
Identify the following quantity as being either a scalar or a vector:
**`r ifelse(n == 0, sample(scalars, 1), sample(vectors, 1))`**

Answerlist
----------
* scalar
* vector
* both scalar and vector
* neither scalar nor vector


Solution
========
A scalar has only magnitude (a number with units). A vector has both magnitude
and direction.


Meta-information
================
exname: scalar or vector
extype: schoice
exsolution: `r ifelse(n == 0, "1000", "0100")`
