```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
n <- sample(0:1, 1)
scalars <- c("\\SI{50}{km}", "\\SI{9.8}{m/s^2}", "\\SI{50}{km/h}", "\\SI{28}{\\celsius}")
vectors <- c("\\SI{50}{km}, \\si{North}", "\\SI{9.8}{m/s^2}, \\si{down}", "\\SI{50}{km/h}, \\si{East}", "\\SI{37}{N}, \\si{right}")
```

Question
========
Identify the following quantity as being either a scalar or a vector:
`r ifelse(n == 0, sample(scalars, 1), sample(vectors, 1))`

Answerlist
----------
* scalar
* vector
* both scalar and vector
* neither scalar nor vector


Solution
========
A scalar has only magnitude (a number with units). A vector has both magnitude
and direction.


Meta-information
================
exname: scalar or vector
extype: schoice
exsolution: `r ifelse(n == 0, "1000", "0100")`
