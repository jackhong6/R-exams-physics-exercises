Question
========
The gravitational acceleration on the Moon is about one-sixth of that on Earth. If you
throw a baseball straight up with the same speed on the Moon as you do on Earth, the ball
would be in the air for

Answerlist
----------
* the same amount of time as on Earth.
* 6 times longer than on Earth
* 12 times longer than on Earth
* 36 times longer than on Earth

Solution
========
The hang time of the ball can be calculated from the formula $v_f = v_i + at$ with $v_f = -v_i$. 

$$t = -\frac{2v_i}{a}$$
On Earth, the time is $t_{Earth} = -2 v_i / g_{Earth}$. On the Moon, $g_{Moon} = g_{Earth} / 6$ so

$$t_{Moon} = -\frac{2 v_i}{g_{Earth} / 6} = 6 \times \frac{-2 v_i}{g_{Earth}} = 6 t_{Earth}$$

The ball would be in the air 6 times longer on the Moon than on Earth.
