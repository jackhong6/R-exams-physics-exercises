Question
========
Ball 1 is dropped from the top of a building. One second later, ball 2 is dropped from the same building. If air resistance can be ignored, then as time progresses (and while the balls are still in free fall), the difference in their speeds


Answerlist
----------
* increases.
* remains constant.
* decreases.
* cannot be determined from the given information.


Solution
========
Since both balls are accelerating at the same rate, the difference in their velocities will remain constant. Using the formula $v_f = v_i + a t$, with $a = g$ and $v_i = 0$, we see that

$$\Delta v = v_1 - v_2 = g t_1 - g t_2 = g (t_1 - t_2)$$
and both $g = \SI{9.8}{m/s^2}$ and $(t_1 - t_2) = 1$ s remain constant.

Note that if air resistance is an important factor, then the difference would change until both balls are falling at their terminal velocity.
