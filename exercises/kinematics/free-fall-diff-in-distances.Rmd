Question
========
Ball 1 is dropped from the top of a building. One second later, ball 2 is dropped from the same building. If air resistance can be ignored, then as time progresses (and while the balls are still in free fall), the distance between them


Answerlist
----------
* increases.
* remains constant.
* decreases.
* cannot be determined from the given information.


Solution
========
The distance between the two balls increases over time since distance increases with time squared when acceleration is constant. Using the distance formula for constant acceleration, we see that
$$\Delta d = d_1 - d_2 = \frac{1}{2} g (t_1^2 - t_2^2) = \frac{1}{2}g(t_1 - t_2)(t_1 + t_2)$$
So even though $(t_1 - t_2)$ will remain constant at 1 second, $(t_1 + t_2)$ increases as time progresses.
