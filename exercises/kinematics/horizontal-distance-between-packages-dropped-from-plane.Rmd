Answerlist
----------
* increase
* decrease
* be constant
* any of the above depending on the weight of the packages

Solution
========
Since vertical acceleration does not affect horizontal velocity, the two packages with the same constant horizontal velocity will remain the same horizontal distance apart (although the vertical distance will increase).
