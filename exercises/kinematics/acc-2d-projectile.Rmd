Question
========
A football is kicked with a velocity of 25 m/s at an angle of $45^\circ$ above
the horizontal. What is the vertical component of its acceleration as it travels
along its trajectory? (Ignore air resistance.)


Answerlist
----------
* $g \sin(45^\circ)$ upward
* $g \sin(45^\circ)$ downward
* $g$ upward
* $g$ downward


Solution
========
For projectile motion on Earth, the acceleration is always $g$ downward.
