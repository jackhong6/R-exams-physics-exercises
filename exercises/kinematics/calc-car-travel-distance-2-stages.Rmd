Question
========
A car travels at 50 km/h for 30 minutes and 80 km/h for 1 hour and 15 minutes. How far does it travel in this time?

Answerlist
----------
* 125 km
* 130 km
* 113.75 km
* 117 km

Solution
========
Use the formula for constant velocity motion for each part and add the two distances together.

$$ d = v_1 t_1 + v_2 t_2 = (50 \,\mathsf{km/h})(0.5 \,\mathsf{h}) + (80 \,\mathsf{km/h})(1.25 \,\mathsf{h}) = 125 \,\mathsf{km}$$
