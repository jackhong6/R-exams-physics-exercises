Question
========
The gravitational acceleration on Mars is about one-third of that on Earth.
If you throw a ball straight up with the same velocity on Mars as on Earth, how
would its maximum height compare to that on Earth?


Answerlist
----------
* The ball would go to 1/3 the maximum height on Earth.
* The ball would go to the same maximum height as on Earth.
* The ball would go 3 times higher than on Earth.
* The ball would go 9 times higher than on Earth.


Solution
========
The max height can be calculated from the formula $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$ with $v_f = 0$ and $a = g$.
$$d = -\frac{v_i^2}{2g}$$
If $g$ is one third as large on Mars, then $d$ would be 3 times larger. Therefore,
the ball would go 3 time higher on Mars than on Earth.
