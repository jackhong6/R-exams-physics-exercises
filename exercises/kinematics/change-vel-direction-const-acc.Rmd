Question
========
Can an object's velocity change direction when its acceleration is constant?

Answerlist
----------
* No, because the object is always speeding up.
* No, because the object is always speeding up or slowing down, but it can never turn around.
* Yes, a rock thrown straight up is an example.
* Yes, a car that starts from rest, speeds up, slows to a stop, and then backs up is an example.

Solution
========
Yes, a rock thrown straight up is an example. The direction of the rock's velocity changes from up to down while its acceleration is always \SI{9.8}{m/s^2} down.
