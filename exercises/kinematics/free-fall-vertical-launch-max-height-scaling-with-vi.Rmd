Question
========
Two balls are launched straight up. The first ball is launched with `r x` times the initial speed of the second. Ignore air resistance. How many times higher does the first ball rise compared to the second?


Answerlist
----------
* $\sqrt{`r x`}$ times as high
* $`r x`$ times as high
* $`r x`^2$ times as high
* Impossible to determine without knowing the initial speeds


Solution
========
Use the formula $v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2ad$ with $v_f = 0$ and solve for $d$:

$$d = -\frac{v_i^2}{2a}$$
The distance scales with the square of the initial velocity. Therefore, the first ball rises $`r x`^2 = `r x^2`$ times as high as the second ball.
