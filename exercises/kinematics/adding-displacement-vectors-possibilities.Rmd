Question
========
Two displacement vectors have magnitudes of \SI{5}{m} and \SI{7}{m}, respectively. When these two vectors are added, the magnitude of the sum

Answerlist
----------
* is \SI{12}{m}
* could be as small as \SI{2}{m}, or as large as \SI{12}{m}
* is \SI{2}{m}
* is larger than \SI{12}{m}


Solution
========
If the two vectors point in the same direction, then the magnitude of their sum is \SI{12}{m}.
If the two vectors point in opposite directions, then the magnitude of their sum is \SI{2}{m}.
Otherwise the magnitude of their sum is somewhere between \SI{2}{m} and \SI{12}{m}
