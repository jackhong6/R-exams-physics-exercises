Question
========
The gravitational acceleration on Mars is about one-third of that on Earth. 
If you hit a baseball on Mars with the same speed and angle that you do on Earth,
the ball would land

Answerlist
----------
* 1/9 times as far
* 1/3 times as far
* 3 times as far
* 9 times as far

Solution
========
The hang time of the ball can be calculated from the formula $v_f = v_i + at$ with $v_f = -v_i$. 

$$t = -\frac{2v_i}{a}$$
On Earth, the time is $t_{Earth} = -2 v_i / g_{Earth}$. On Mars, $g_{Mars} = g_{Earth} / 3$ so

$$t_{Mars} = -\frac{2 v_i}{g_{Earth} / 3} = 3 \times \frac{-2 v_i}{g_{Earth}} = 3 t_{Earth}$$

The ball is in the air 3 times longer on Mars than on Earth. Since the horizontal velocity is the same, the ball will travel 3 times as far.
