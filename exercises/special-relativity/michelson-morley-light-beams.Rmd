Question
========
Why did Michelson and Morley orient light beams at right angles to each other?

Answerlist
----------
* To observe the wave-particle duality of light.
* To obtain an interference pattern that would indicate how much the speed of
  light differs when moving in different directions.
* To obtain a diffraction pattern that would indicate if the speed of light 
  is constant in all frames of reference regardless of their motion.
* To observe the scattering of photons at 90 degrees that could be analyzed to   see if light is an electromagnetic wave.

Solution
========
The two light beams form an interferometer. When the light beams recombine, they
make an interference pattern that would indicate if the speed of light is different
in each direction.
