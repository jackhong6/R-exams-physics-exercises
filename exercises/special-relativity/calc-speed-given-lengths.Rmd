```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
L <- sample(30:100, 2)
L0 <- max(L)
L <- min(L)

g <- L0 / L

ans <- sqrt(1 - 1 / g^2) # v / c

sc <- num_to_schoice(ans, range = c(0, 1), delta = 0.01, format = FALSE, digits = 6)
sc$questions <- sprintf("$%s c$", fmt(sc$questions, 3))
```

Question
========
Suppose you decide to travel to a star `r fmt(L0, 1)` light-years away in the reference frame of the Earth. How fast would you have to travel so that the distance would be only `r fmt(L, 1)` light years?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
The Lorentz factor is

$$ \gamma = \frac{L_0}{L} = `r fmt(g, 3)` $$
We solve for $v$ in terms of $\gamma$

$$ \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{`r g`^2}} = `r fmt(ans, 3)` $$
