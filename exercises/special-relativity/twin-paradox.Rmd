Question
========
An astronaut goes on a long space voyage near the speed of light. When he returns
home, how will his age compare to the age of his twin who stayed on Earth?

Answerlist
----------
* Both will be the same age because each can claim that it was the other who was moving.
* The astronaut will be older than his twin because of time dilation.
* The astronaut will be younger than his twin because of time dilation.
* This is a paradox in special relativity that does not have a clear answer.

Solution
========
Time dilation means that moving clocks run slow. The astronaut is moving and so his
clock runs slow. Therefore, the astronaut will be younger than his twin.
Note that since the astronaut must turn around to travel back to the Earth, 
he cannot analyze the situation with the time dilation formula that only applies
for an observer in a single inertial reference frame.
