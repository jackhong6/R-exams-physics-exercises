Question
========
Why was it once believed that light must travel through a medium called the *ether*
and could not propagate across empty space?

Answerlist
----------
* Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism implies this.
* Light shows the phenomenon of diffraction and interference.
* The speed of light is the maximum possible speed.
* All other known waves need a medium to travel through.

Solution
========
All other waves, such as sound and ocean waves, need a medium to travel through
(e.g. air or water). Light, which is an electromagnetic wave according to Maxwell's
theory, is the only wave that can propagate through empty space.
