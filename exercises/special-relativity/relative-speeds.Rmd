```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
v <- runif(1, 0.1, 0.99)
```

Question
========
In your spaceship, you see an alien spaceship moving at $`r fmt(v, 2)`c$. Considering the effects of time dilation and length contraction, the aliens would see your spaceship moving

Answerlist
----------
* faster than $`r fmt(v, 2)`c$
* at $`r fmt(v, 2)`c$
* slower than $`r fmt(v, 2)`c$
* not enough information to determine

Solution
========
Relative speeds are not affected under Lorentz transformations. The aliens would see your spaceship moving at $`r fmt(v, 2)`c$ (but in the opposite direction).
