Question
========
A pilot, of mass $m$, executes a vertical dive, then follows a semi-circular arc until the plane
is going straight up. Just as the plane is at its lowest point, the force that the pilot's seat
exerts on him is


Answerlist
----------
* less than $mg$ and pointing up
* less than $mg$ and pointing down
* more than $mg$ and pointing up
* more than $mg$ and pointing down

Solution
========
The centripetal force points towards the centre of the circle, which would be
upward. This force must oppose and overcome the pilot's weight, so it is more
than $mg$.
