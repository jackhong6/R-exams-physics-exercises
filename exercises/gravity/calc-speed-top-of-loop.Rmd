```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
r <- sample(1000:5000, 1) # loop radius (m)
n <- sample(2:9, 1) # denominator

ans <- sqrt(r * 9.8 * (1 - 1/n))

sc <- num_to_schoice(ans, delta = ans/10, format = FALSE)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%.0f m/s", sc$questions)
```
Question
========
A pilot makes an outside vertical loop (in which the path of the plane traces out the 
top half of a circle with centre of the loop beneath the plane) of radius `r r` m.
At the top of his loop, he is pushing down on his seat with only $1/`r n`$ of 
his normal weight. How fast is he going?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
The centripetal force is
$$\frac{mv^2}{r} = mg(1 - 1/`r n`)$$
Solving for $v$ gives
$$v = \sqrt{gr(1 - 1/`r n`)} = `r fmt(ans, 0)` \text{ m/s}$$
