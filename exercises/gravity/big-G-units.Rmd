Question
========
What are the units of $G$, the universal gravitational constant?

Answerlist
----------
* \unit{N.m^2.kg^{-2}}
* \unit{m^3.kg^{-1}.s^{-2}}
* \unit{m.s^{-2}}
* \unit{kg.m/s}
* \unit{kg.m/s^2}
* $G$ does not have any units

Solution
========
The universal gravitational constant is defined in Newton's law of universal gravitation:
$$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
The constant relates the combination of mass and distance units to force units. Therefore,
it must have units of

$$\unit{N.m^2.kg^{-2}}$$

Or, since $\unit{N} = \unit{kg.m/s^2}$, the units of $G$ are also

$$\unit{m^3.kg^{-1}.s^{-2}}$$
