```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
v <- sample(20:80, 1) # km/h
n <- sample(2:6, 1) # n times radius

ans <- sqrt(n) * v # 

sc <- num_to_schoice(ans, delta = ans/10, format = FALSE)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%.1f km/h", sc$questions)
```
Question
========
The maximum speed around a level circular curve is `r fmt(v, 1)` km/h. What is the 
maximum speed around a curve with `r n` times the radius? Assume all other
factors remain unchanged.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
For uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is given by
$$F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
If $r \to `r n` r$, then to maintain the same centripetal force (since the friction
is assumed to be the same) we must have $v \to \sqrt{`r n`} v = `r fmt(ans, 1)`$ km/h.
