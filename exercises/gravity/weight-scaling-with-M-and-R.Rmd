```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
m <- sample(2:9, 1)
r <- sample(2:9, 1)
ans <- 100 * m / r^2

Question
========
A planet has `r m` times the earth's mass and `r r` times the earth's radius.
If an object weighs 100 N on earth, how much would it weigh on this planet?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
The gravitational field strength on the surface of a planet is
$$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$
So the gravitational field strength on the planet is
$$g_{planet} = \frac{G(`r m` M_{earth})}{(`r r`r_{earth})^2} = \frac{`r m`}{`r r^2`} g_{earth}$$
So the 100 N object would weigh
$$(100 N)\frac{`r m`}{`r r^2`} = `r fmt(ans,1)` N$$
