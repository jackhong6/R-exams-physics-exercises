Question
========
A rock, of mass $m$, is attached to a string and whirled in a vertical circle of
radius $r$. At the top of the circle, the tension in the string is $`r n`$
times the rock's weight. The rock's speed at this point is given by

Answerlist
----------
* $`r n` \sqrt{gr}$
* $\sqrt{`r n` g r}$
* $\sqrt{`r n+1` g r}$
* $\sqrt{`r n-1` g r}$

Solution
========
The net force at the top of the circle is the tension in the string plus the 
weight of the rock. This net force is the centripetal force for circular motion.
$$\frac{mv^2}{r} = F_{tension} + mg$$
We are also given in the problem that $F_{tension} = `r n` mg$. Putting this into
the equation above and solving for $v$ gives
$$v = \sqrt{`r n+1` gr}$$
