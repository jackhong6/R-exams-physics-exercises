Question
========
Consider a satellite moving in a circular orbit of radius $r$ around a planet of
mass $M$. Which expression gives the satellite's orbital speed?

Answerlist
----------
* $\sqrt{GM/r}$
* $\sqrt{GM/r^2}$
* $\sqrt{2GM/r}$
* $\sqrt{Gr}$
* $\sqrt{2GM/r^2}$
* $GM/r$
* $GM/r^2$

Solution
========
The centripetal force is the gravitational force for a circular orbit.
$$\frac{mv^2}{r} = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
Solving for $v$ gives
$$v = \sqrt{GM/r}$$
