Question
========
As more resistors are added in **series** to a constant voltage source, the power
supplied by the source

Answerlist
----------
* increases.
* decreases.
* remains the same.
* not enough information.

Solution
========
The total resistance increases, causing the total current to decrease. Since the
voltage is constant and $P = IV$, the power decreases.
