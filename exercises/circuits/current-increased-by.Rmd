Question
========
The current flowing in an electric circuit can be increased by

Answerlist
----------
* increasing voltage and decreasing resistance
* decreasing voltage and increasing resistance
* increasing voltage and increasing resistance
* decreasing voltage and decreasing resistance

Solution
========
Ohm's law states that

$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$
Therefore, current can be increased by increasing voltage and decreasing resistance.
