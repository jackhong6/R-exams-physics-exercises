Question
========
You have a $5 \,\mathsf{\Omega}$ light bulb and a $10 \,\mathsf{\Omega}$ light bulb.
You make a circuit that places them in series across a battery. Which light
bulb is brighter?

Answerlist
----------
* The $5 \,\mathsf{\Omega}$ bulb is brighter.
* The $10 \,\mathsf{\Omega}$ bulb is brighter.
* Both bulbs glow at the same brightness.
* It depends on the voltage.

Solution
========
The current through both bulbs is the same since they are placed in series. However,
the voltage drop is greater for the greater resistance. Since $P = IV$, and $V$ is
greater for the greater resistance, the $10 \,\mathsf{\Omega}$ light bulb is brighter.
