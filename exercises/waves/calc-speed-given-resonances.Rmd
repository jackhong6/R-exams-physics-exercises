```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
f <- sample(350:400, 1)
s <- signif(runif(1, 40, 50), 3)

ans <- 2 * s / 100 * f

sc <- num_to_schoice(ans, delta = ans/10, format = FALSE, digits = 6)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%g m/s", signif(sc$questions, 3))
```

Question
========
A tuning fork has a frequency of `r f` Hz. The fork causes resonances in an air column
spaced at `r s` cm. What is the speed of the sound?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
The spacing between resonances is half a wavelength. Therefore, the wavelength is

$$ \lambda = 2(`r s` \,\mathsf{cm}) = `r 2*s` \,\mathsf{cm} $$
Speed is frequency times wavelength.

$$ v = f \lambda = (`r f` \,\mathsf{Hz})(`r 2*s` \,\mathsf{cm}) = `r fmt(ans, 0)` \,\mathsf{m/s}$$
