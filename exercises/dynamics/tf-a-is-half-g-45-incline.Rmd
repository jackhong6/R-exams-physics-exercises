Question
========
True or false? An object sliding down a 45 degree incline without friction is
accelerating at half the acceleration of gravity.

Answerlist
----------
* True
* False


Solution
========
False. The acceleration of an object on a frictionless inclined plane is given 
by the equation $a = g \sin \theta$ and $\sin(\ang{45}) \neq 1/2$.
