Question
========
A leg press machine is inclined at $`r fmt(a, 1)`^\circ$ from the horizontal. The total mass to be pressed
up is $`r fmt(m, 1)`$ kg. What force must the legs apply to move the mass at a constant 
velocity? Assume that friction is negligible.

```

Solution
========
The forces must be balanced for the mass to be moving at constant velocity. The
legs must apply a force equal to the parallel component of the force of gravity.
$$F = mg \sin(`r a`^\circ) = `r fmt(ans, 0)` \text{ N}$$
