```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
a <- sample(1:20, 1) # acceleration (m/s^2)
m <- sample(1:20, 1) # mass (kg)
f <- m * a # force (N)

sc <- num_to_schoice(f, delta = f/10, format = FALSE)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%g N", signif(sc$questions, 2))
```

Question
========
An object of mass \SI{`r fmt(m,1)`}{kg} accelerates at \SI{`r fmt(a,1)`}{m/s^2}. What is the magnitude of 
the net force on the object?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
========
According to Newton's Second Law of Motion
$$
F = ma = (\SI{`r m`}{kg})(\SI{`r a`}{m/s^2}) = \SI{`r signif(f, 2)`}{N}
$$
