Question
========
A box that weighs 100 N rests on a digital scale on the floor of an elevator. 
When would the scale measure a value less than 100 N? *Select all that apply.*


Answerlist
----------
* moving upward with increasing speed.
* moving upward with decreasing speed.
* moving downward with increasing speed.
* moving downward with decreasing speed.

Solution
========
The force of gravity is always downward while the normal force provided by the
scale always points upward. The scale measures the normal force on it. 
If the acceleration is upward, then the normal force must be greater (so the scale
would measure a greater weight). If the acceleration is downward, then the normal
force must be less (so the scale would measure a smaller weight).

The acceleration is downward when the elevator is moving down with increasing speed and
when the elevator is moving up with decreasing speed.
