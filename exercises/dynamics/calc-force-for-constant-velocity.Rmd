```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
m <- sample(10:99, 1) # mass (kg)
mu <- signif(runif(1, 0.2, 0.7), 2) # coefficient of kinetic friction
ans <- mu * m * 9.8
dis <- c(mu * m)

sc <- num_to_schoice(ans, wrong = dis, format = FALSE, delta = ans/10)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%g N", signif(sc$questions, 2))
```

Question
========
What force is needed to keep a `r m`-kg box moving at a constant velocity across
a warehouse floor if the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the floor is `r fmt(mu, 2)`?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
========
The applied force needed for constant velocity (zero acceleration) is one that balances the friction force.
$$F_f = \mu_k F_N = \mu m g = (`r mu`)(\SI{`r m`}{kg})(\SI{9.8}{N/kg}) = \SI{`r signif(ans, 2)`}{N}$$
