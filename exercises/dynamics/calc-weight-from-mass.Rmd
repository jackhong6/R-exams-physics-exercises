```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
m <- sample(10:99, 1) # mass (kg)
w <- m * 9.8 # weight (N)

distractors <- c(m / 9.8, m)
sc <- num_to_schoice(w, wrong = distractors, delta = 10, format = FALSE)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%g N", signif(sc$questions, 2))
```

Question
========
The mass of an object is `r m` kg. What is its weight on Earth?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
========
Weight is related to mass by
$$
W = m g = (\SI{`r m`}{kg})(\SI{9.8}{N/kg}) = \SI{`r signif(w, 2)`}{N}
$$
