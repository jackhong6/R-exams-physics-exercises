Question
========
In a rugby game, Bob (mass = `r m[1]` kg) tackles Joe (mass = `r m[2]` kg)
and knocks Joe to the ground. During the collision, who applied the greater force
on whom?

Answerlist
----------
* Bob applied a greater force on Joe (than Joe did on him).
* Joe applied a greater force on Bob (than Bob did on him).
* Bob and Joe applied the same magnitude force on each other.
* It depends on the relative speeds of Bob and Joe.

Solution
========
According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, the force of Bob on Joe is equal (but
opposite) the force of Joe on Bob.
