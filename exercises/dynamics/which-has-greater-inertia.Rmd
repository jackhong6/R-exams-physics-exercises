```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
m <- sample(2:7, 1) # mass of bowling ball (kg)
v <- sample(2:12, 1) # speed of bowling ball (m/s)
```

Question
========
Which has greater inertia? A bowling ball of mass `r m` kg traveling at `r v` m/s
or a bullet of mass `r m/100` kg traveling at `r v*100` m/s?

Answerlist
----------
* The bowling ball.
* The bullet.
* The bowling ball and the bullet have the same inertia.
* Not enough information to determine.

Solution
========
Inertia depends only on mass. The bowling ball has the greater mass. Therefore, the bowling ball has the greater inertia.
