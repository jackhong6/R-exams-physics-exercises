f <- x[2]

Question
========
A person of mass $`r m`$ kg pushes on a wall with $`r f`$ N of force. What is
the magnitude of the force that the wall exerts on the person?

Answerlist
----------
* $`r f`$ N
* $`r signif(m * 9.8, 2)`$ N
* $`r signif(f * 9.8, 2)`$ N
* $`r signif(f / 9.8, 2)`$ N

Solution
========
According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, the wall exerts an equal and opposite
force on the person (the person's mass has nothing to do with the answer).
