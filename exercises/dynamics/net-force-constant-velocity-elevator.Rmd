```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
v <- sample(1:10, 1)
```

Question
========
What is the net force on a person who is standing in an elevator moving up with
a constant velocity of $`r fmt(v, 2)`$ m/s?

Answerlist
----------
* $0$ N
* $`r fmt(v, 2)`$ N, up
* $`r fmt(v, 2)`$ N, down
* It depends on the mass of the person.

Solution
========
The elevator is moving with constant velocity so the acceleration is zero and
the net force must also be zero.
