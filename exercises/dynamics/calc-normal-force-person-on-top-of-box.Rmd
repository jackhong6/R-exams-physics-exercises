```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
mp <- sample(20:99, 1) # mass of person (kg)
mb <- sample(2:20, 1) # mass of box (kg)
ans <- (mp + mb) * 9.8 # normal force (N)
dis <- c(mb * 9.8, mp * 9.8, (mp - mb) * 9.8)

sc <- num_to_schoice(ans, wrong = dis, format = FALSE)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%g N", signif(sc$questions, 3))
```

Question
========
A person (mass = `r mp` kg) stands on top of a box (mass = `r mb` kg) on the ground. What is the magnitude of the
normal force that the ground applies to the box?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
The normal force is
$$F_N = (\SI{`r mp`}{kg} + \SI{`r mb`}{kg})(\SI{9.80}{N/kg}) = \SI{`r signif(ans, 3)`}{N}$$
