Question
========
Two forces have magnitudes of 5 N and 7 N, respectively. When these two 
forces are added, the magnitude of the sum

Answerlist
----------
* could be any value
* could be any value between 2 N and 12 N (inclusive)
* must be either 2 N or 12 N
* must be 12 N


Solution
========
If the two vectors point in the same direction, then the magnitude of their sum is 12 N.
If the two vectors point in opposite directions, then the magnitude of their sum is 2 N.
Otherwise, the magnitude of their sum is somewhere between 2 N and 12 N.
The correct answer is "could be any value between 2 N and 12 N".
