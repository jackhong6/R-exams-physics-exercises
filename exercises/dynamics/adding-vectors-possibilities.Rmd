```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
f <- sample(1:20, 2)
d <- abs(f[1] - f[2])
s <- sum(f)
```
Question
========
Two forces have magnitudes of `r f[1]` N and `r f[2]` N, respectively. When these two 
forces are added, the magnitude of the sum

Answerlist
----------
* could be any value
* could be any value between `r d` N and `r s` N (inclusive)
* must be either `r d` N or `r s` N
* must be `r s` N


Solution
========
Vectors are added "tip to tail".
If the two vectors point in the same direction, then the magnitude of their sum is `r s` N.
If the two vectors point in opposite directions, then the magnitude of their sum is `r d` N.
Otherwise, the magnitude of their sum is somewhere between `r d` N and `r s` N.
