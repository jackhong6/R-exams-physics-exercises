Question
========
Why is a greater force needed to start moving a heavy box from rest than to
keep pushing it with constant velocity? In the choices below, $\mu_k$ is the 
coefficient of kinetic friction and $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction.

Answerlist
----------
* The normal force is greater when the box is at rest.
* The inertia of the box is greater when it is at rest.
* $\mu_s < \mu_k$
* $\mu_k < \mu_s$

Solution
========
$\mu_k < \mu_s$. The coefficient of kinetic friction is less than the coefficient
of static friction.
