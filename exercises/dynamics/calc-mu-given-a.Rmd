Question
========
A box slides on the floor in the $+x$ direction. It slows down and comes
to a stop with a constant acceleration of $-\SI{`r a`}{m/s^2}$. The only force that is slowing down the box is the friction between the box and the floor. What is the
coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the floor?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
The net force is the friction force, so
$$F_f = F_{net} = ma$$
The normal force, $F_N$, is the weight of the box, $mg$, so
$$\mu_k = \frac{F_f}{F_N} = \frac{ma}{mg} = \frac{a}{g} = \frac{`r a`}{9.80} = `r mu`$$
