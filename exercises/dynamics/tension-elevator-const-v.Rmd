Question
========
A box, of mass $M$, is suspended by a string from the ceiling inside an elevator.
The elevator is traveling downward with a constant speed. The tension in the string is

Answerlist
----------
* less than $Mg$.
* equal to $Mg$.
* greater than $Mg$.
* impossible to determine without knowing the speed.

Solution
========
The elevator is moving with constant velocity so the acceleration is zero and
the net force must also be zero. Therefore, the tension force must balance 
(equal) the gravitational force, $Mg$.
