Question
========
A student puts two objects on a physics book and carefully tilts the cover. At a
small angle, object A starts to slide. At a larger angle, object B starts to
slide. Which has the greater coefficient of static friction with the book cover?

Answerlist
----------
* Object A
* Object B


Solution
========
As shown in the example on p. 126, the coefficient of static friction is equal
to $\tan \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle at which the object starts to
slide. The tangent function increases with the angle so it is greater for
greater angles. Therefore, object B, which starts sliding at a greater angle,
has the greater coefficient of static friction.
