Question
========
A physics textbook of mass $m$ is at rest on a flat table. Earth's gravity applies a downward force $mg$ on the book, which we will call the action force. What is the reaction force?

Answerlist
----------
* The table pushing up on the book with force $mg$.
* The book pushing down on the table with force $mg$.
* The table pushing down on the floor with force $mg$.
* The book pulling upward on the Earth with force $mg$.

Solution
========
Action-reaction force pairs are always between the same two objects. 
The reaction force to the Earth pulling down on the book is the book pulling 
upward on the Earth with force.
