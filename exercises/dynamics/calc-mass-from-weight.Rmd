```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
w <- sample(10:99, 1) # weight (N)
m <- w / 9.8 # mass (kg)

distractors <- c(w * 9.8, w)
sc <- num_to_schoice(m, wrong = distractors, delta = m/10, format = FALSE)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%g kg", signif(sc$questions, 2))
```

Question
========
An object weight `r w` N on Earth. What is its mass?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
========
Weight is related to mass by
$$
m = W / g = (\SI{`r w`}{N}) / (\SI{9.8}{N/kg}) = \SI{`r signif(m, 2)`}{kg}
$$
