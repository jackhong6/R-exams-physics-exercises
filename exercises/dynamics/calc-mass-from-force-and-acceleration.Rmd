```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
f <- sample(100:999, 1) # weight (N)
a <- sample(10:99, 1) # acceleration (m/s^2)
m <- f / a # mass (kg)

distractors <- c(f * a, a / f)
sc <- num_to_schoice(m, wrong = distractors, delta = m/10, format = FALSE)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%g kg", signif(sc$questions, 2))
```

Question
========
A net force of `r f` N acts on an object, and it accelerates at `r a` m/s/s
in the direction of the net force. What is the mass of the object?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
========
According to Newton's Second Law of Motion
$$
m = F / a = (\SI{`r f`}{N}) / (\SI{`r a`}{m/s^2}) = \SI{`r signif(m, 2)`}{kg}
$$
