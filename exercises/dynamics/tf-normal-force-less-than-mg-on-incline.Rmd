Question
========
True or false? The normal force on an object of mass $M$ at rest on an inclined 
plane is less than $Mg$. Assume that the plane is inclined at a positive acute angle
and that only gravity and the normal force act on the object.


Answerlist
----------
* True
* False


Solution
========
True. The normal force on an inclined plane is $Mg \cos \theta$ and $\cos \theta$
is always less than one for positive acute angles.
