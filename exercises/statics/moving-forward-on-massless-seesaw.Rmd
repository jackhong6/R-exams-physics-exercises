Question
========
A heavy child and a lightweight child are balanced on a massless seesaw. If both children move forward so that they are at half of their original distance from the pivot, what will happen to the seesaw?


Answerlist
----------
* The side the heavy child is sitting on will tilt downward.
* The side the lightweight child is sitting on will tilt downward.
* The seesaw will still be balanced.
* It is impossible to determine without knowing the masses and distances.


Solution
========
Since the seesaw is initially balanced, we must have 
$$\tau_{net} = m_{1} d_{1} - m_{2} d_{2} = 0$$

Halving both distances will result in 
$$\tau_{net} = m_1 (d_1/2) - m_2 (d_2/2) = \frac{1}{2}(m_1 d_1 - m_2 d_2) = \frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$$

Therefore, the seesaw will remain balanced.
