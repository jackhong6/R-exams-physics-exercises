```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
w <- sample(1:10, 1) # in Newtons
```


Question
========
A book weighs \SI{`r w`}{N} at the surface of the Earth. When held at rest on top of your head, the net force on the book is

Answerlist
----------
* \SI{`r w`}{N}
* \SI{`r -w`}{N}
* \SI{9.8}{N}
* \SI{0}{N}

Solution
========
Since the book is at rest, its acceleration is zero and the net force acting on it must be zero.
