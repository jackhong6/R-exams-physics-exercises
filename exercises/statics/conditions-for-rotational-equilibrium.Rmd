Question
========
What conditions are necessary for a body to be in **rotational** equilibrium? Note that $\sum \boldsymbol{\vec{F}}$ is the net force on the body and $\sum \boldsymbol{\vec{\tau}}$ is the net torque on the body.

Answerlist
----------
* $\sum \boldsymbol{\vec{F}} = 0$
* $\sum \boldsymbol{\vec{\tau}} = 0$
* $\sum \boldsymbol{\vec{F}} = 0$ and $\sum \boldsymbol{\vec{\tau}} = 0$
* None of the above

Solution
========
A body is in rotational equilibrium if the net torque on the body is zero ($\sum \boldsymbol{\vec{\tau}} = 0$).
