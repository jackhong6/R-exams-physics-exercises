Question
========
A rocket moves through outer space with a constant velocity of \SI{9.8}{m/s} toward the Andromeda galaxy. What is the net force acting on the rocket?

Answerlist
----------
* A force equal to its weight on Earth, $mg$.
* A force equal to the gravity acting on it.
* The net force is zero.
* Cannot be determined without more information.

Solution
========
Since the rocket is moving with constant velocity, its acceleration is zero and the net force acting on the rocket must also be zero.
