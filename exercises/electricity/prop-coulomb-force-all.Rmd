Question
========
Two charged objects repel each other with a force $F$. What is the force between
them if one of the charges is multiplied by $`r x[1]`$, the other charge is 
multiplied by $`r x[2]`$, and the distance between them is reduced to 
$1/`r x[3]`$ its original value? 


Answerlist
----------
* $`r x[1] * x[2] * x[3]^2` \, F$
* $(`r x[1] * x[2]` / `r x[3]^2`) \, F$
* $(`r x[1] * x[2]` / `r x[3]`) \, F$
* $`r prod(x)` \,F$


Solution
========
The formula for the coulomb force shows that it is proportional to both charges
and inversely proportional to the distance squared:

$$F = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$
Therefore, the answer is $`r x[1]` \times `r x[2]` \times `r x[3]`^2 \, F= `r x[1] * x[2] * x[3]^2` \, F$.
