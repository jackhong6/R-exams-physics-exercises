Question
========
Two point charges are separated by a distance of $`r d[1]` \mathsf{\,cm}$. 
Their electric potential energy is $1 \mathsf{\,J}$, relative to infinity. 
What would their electric potential energy be if the separation is changed to $`r d[2]` \mathsf{\,cm}$?


Answerlist
----------
* $(`r d[1]` / `r d[2]`) \mathsf{\,J}$
* $(`r d[2]` / `r d[1]`) \mathsf{\,J}$
* $(`r d[1]` / `r d[2]`)^2 \mathsf{\,J}$
* $(`r d[2]` / `r d[1]`)^2 \mathsf{\,J}$


Solution
========
The formula for the electric potential energy shows that it is inversely proportional to the
distance:

$$E_p = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{r}$$

Let $r_1 = `r d[1]`$ cm and $r_2 = `r d[2]`$ cm. The ratio between the potential energy
at $r_1$ and $r_2$ is

$$\frac{E_{p,2}}{E_{p,1}} = \frac{k q_1 q_2 / r_2}{k q_1 q_2 / r_1} 
= \frac{r_1}{r_2} = \frac{`r d[1]`}{`r d[2]`}$$

Since $E_{p,1} = 1 \mathsf{\,J}$, the coulomb force when the separation is $`r d[2]` \mathsf{\,cm}$ is 
$(`r d[1]` / `r d[2]`) \mathsf{\,J}$.
