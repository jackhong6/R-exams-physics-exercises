Question
========
A cyclist going down a hill wants to shift gears to decrease his bicycle's
mechanical advantage. This would make it so that he can exert greater effort 
force on the bike. Which sprocket changes would result in a smaller mechanical
advantage? *Select all that apply.*


Answerlist
----------
* increase front sprocket radius.
* increase rear sprocket radius.
* decrease front sprocket radius.
* decrease rear sprocket radius.


Solution
========
The ideal mechanical advantage of a bicycle is

$$IMA = \frac{\text{rear sprocket radius}}{\text{front sprocket radius}} \cdot 
\frac{\text{pedal radius}}{\text{wheel radius}}$$

To decrease the ideal mechanical advantage (which would also decrease the 
mechanical advantage if the efficiency does not change significantly), we can
decrease the rear sprocket radius or increase the front sprocket radius.
