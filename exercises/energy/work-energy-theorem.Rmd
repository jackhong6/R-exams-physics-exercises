Question
========
The net work done on an object is equal to its

Answerlist
----------
* change in kinetic energy.
* change in potential energy.
* change in total mechanical energy.
* change in velocity.


Solution
========
According to the work-energy theorem, the net work done on an object is equal to
its change in kinetic energy. Note that the net work could include *negative* work done by
gravity or friction so that an applied force could do work on an object without
increasing its kinetic energy.
