KE <- sample(10:99, 1) # kinetic energy gained (J)
```

Question
========
A ball drops some distance and gains `r KE` J of kinetic energy. Do **NOT** ignore
air resistance. How much gravitational potential energy did the ball lose?


Answerlist
----------
* More than `r KE` J.
* Exactly `r KE` J.
* Less than `r KE` J.
* Cannot be determined.


Solution
========
Some of the potential energy was transformed into kinetic energy and some into
non-mechanical energy (heat, sound, vibrations, etc.) because of the air resistance.
Therefore, the potential energy lost is more than the kinetic energy gained.
