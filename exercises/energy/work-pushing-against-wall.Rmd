```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
p1 <- sample(c("Albert", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dave", "Joe"), 1)
p2 <- sample(c("Mary", "Nicole", "Olivia", "Rachel", "Zoe"), 1)
t <- sample(10:30, 1)
```

Question
========
`r p1` pushes against a brick wall for `r t` seconds. `r p2` pushes against the
same wall for `r 2*t` seconds. The wall does not move. Compare the work done by 
each person.


Answerlist
----------
* `r p2` does $2$ times as much work as `r p1`.
* `r p2` does $`r t`$ seconds more work than `r p1`.
* The work done by each person depends on the force they applied.
* Both `r p1` and `r p2` do no work.


Solution
========
Work is force times distance ($W=Fd$). Since the wall does not move ($d=0$),
they both do no work.
