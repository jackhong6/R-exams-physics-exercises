Question
========
A cyclist climbing up a hill wants to shift gears to increase his bicycle's
mechanical advantage. This would make it so that a smaller effort force is
needed to overcome the force of gravity on the bike. Which sprocket changes
would result in a greater mechanical advantage? *Select all that apply.*


Answerlist
----------
* increase front sprocket radius.
* increase rear sprocket radius.
* decrease front sprocket radius.
* decrease rear sprocket radius.


Solution
========
The ideal mechanical advantage of a bicycle is

$$IMA = \frac{\text{rear sprocket radius}}{\text{front sprocket radius}} \cdot 
\frac{\text{pedal radius}}{\text{wheel radius}}$$

To increase the ideal mechanical advantage (which would also increase the 
mechanical advantage if the efficiency does not change significantly), we can
increase the rear sprocket radius or decrease the front sprocket radius.
