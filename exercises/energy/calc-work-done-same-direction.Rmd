```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
w <- sample(1:10, 1) # weight (N)
h <- sample(1:10, 1) # height (m)

ans <- w * h # work (J)
dis <- c(0, w * 9.8 * h)

sc <- num_to_schoice(ans, wrong = dis, delta = 0.1, format = FALSE, digits = 1)
sc$questions <- sprintf("%.1f J", sc$questions)
```

Question
========
How much work is done if you raise a `r fmt(w, 1)` N weight `r fmt(h, 1)` m above the ground?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```


Solution
========
Work is force times distance.
$$W = Fd = (`r fmt(w,1)` \text{ N})(`r fmt(h, 1)` \text{ m}) = `r fmt(ans, 1)` \text{ J}$$
