PE <- sample(10:99, 1) # potential energy lost (J)
```

Question
========
A ball drops some distance and loses `r PE` J of gravitational potential energy. Do **NOT** ignore
air resistance. How much kinetic energy did the ball gain?


Answerlist
----------
* More than `r PE` J.
* Exactly `r PE` J.
* Less than `r PE` J.
* Cannot be determined.


Solution
========
Some of the potential energy was transformed into kinetic energy and some into
non-mechanical energy (heat, sound, vibrations, etc.) because of the air resistance.
Therefore, the kinetic energy gained is less than the potential energy lost.
