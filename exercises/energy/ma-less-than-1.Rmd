Question
========
A simple machine with mechanical advantage less than 1

Answerlist
----------
* increases friction.
* increases energy.
* increases effort force.
* decreases effort force.

Solution
========
The mechanical advantage, $MA$, of a simple machine is
$$MA = \frac{F_r}{F_e}$$
If this ratio is less than $1$, then $F_r < F_e$. This means that the simple
machine decreases the effort force.
