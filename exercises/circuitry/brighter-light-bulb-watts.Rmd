Question
========
You have a $60 \,\mathsf{W}$ light bulb and a $100 \,\mathsf{W}$ light bulb.
Instead of connecting them the normal way, you make a circuit that places them
in series across the normal household voltage. Which statement is correct?

Answerlist
----------
* Both bulbs glow at the same reduced brightness.
* Both bulbs glow at the same increased brightness.
* The $100 \,\mathsf{W}$ bulb glows brighter than the $60 \,\mathsf{W}$ bulb.
* The $60 \,\mathsf{W}$ bulb glows brighter than the $100 \,\mathsf{W}$ bulb.

Solution
========
The $60 \,\mathsf{W}$ bulb has a higher resistance than the $100 \,\mathsf{W}$,
which is why it is normally dimmer (bulbs are normally connected in parallel).
However, when the two bulbs are connected in series, there is a greater voltage
drop across the $60 \,\mathsf{W}$, making it brighter (the current is the same 
for bulbs in series).
