```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
R <- sample(100:999, 1) / 1000 # resistance (ohms)
n <- sample(100:999, 1) # number of resistors in series

ans <- n * R

sc <- num_to_schoice(ans, delta = ans/10, format = FALSE, digits = 5)
sc$questions <- sprintf("$%g \\,\\mathsf{\\Omega}$", signif(sc$questions, 2))
```
Question
========
A total of `r n` Christmas light bulbs, all with resistance $`r R` \,\mathsf{\Omega}$, 
are connected in **series**. What is the equivalent resistance of the lights?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
answerlist(sc$questions, markup = "markdown")
```

Solution
========
The equivalent resistance of resistors in series when they all have the same resistance $R_i$ is 

$$R = R_i + R_i + R_i + ... + R_i = `r n` R_i = `r signif(ans, 2)` \,\mathsf{k\Omega}$$
