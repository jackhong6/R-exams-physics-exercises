Question
========
As more resistors are added in **parallel** to a constant voltage source, the power
supplied by the source

Answerlist
----------
* increases.
* decreases.
* remains the same.
* not enough information.

Solution
========
The total resistance decreases because resistors in parallel provide more paths
for the current to go through, causing the total current to increase. Since the
voltage is constant and $P = IV$, the power increases.
